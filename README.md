# Sepia-CRUD-Website
A website I made for a school project demonstrating a RESTful API website utilizing CRUD SQL techniques and node.js along with sanitization 

Heres a link of the website working with a node.js server. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFE13vldAtw

I swear the app is also responsive and compatible with mobile devices, I just didnt want to show a video with a rapidly changing aspect ratio
